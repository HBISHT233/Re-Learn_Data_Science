# Re-Learn Data Science

Hello and welcome to the journey of re-learning the skills you may have mastered in the past but have become a bit rusty over time due to inactivity. If you're eager to sharpen your tools and refresh your knowledge, you've come to the right place! This repository is designed to help you recall, practice, and enhance your data science skills step by step.

## Why Re-Learn Data Science?

Over time, it's natural for skills to dull if they're not put to use regularly. Whether it's due to shifting roles, other priorities, or simply time away from the field, the once-sharp edges of our knowledge can fade. **Re-Learn Data Science** is here to help you revisit the essential concepts and techniques that form the foundation of modern data science, so you can confidently apply them once again.

## What's Included:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for handling missing values, scaling, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data, identifying trends, and extracting meaningful insights.
- **Supervised Learning**: Revisiting regression and classification algorithms, from basics to advanced techniques like decision trees and ensemble models.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE), and anomaly detection.
- **Model Evaluation & Tuning**: Cross-validation, model performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score), and hyperparameter optimization.
- **Practical Implementation**: Jupyter notebooks with Python, covering libraries like `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and more.
- **Real-world Applications**: Work through case studies and datasets such as Titanic, Iris, and others to practice data science workflows.

## How to Get Started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HBISHT233/Re-Learn_Data_Science.git
   ```
2. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to begin your re-learning journey.
3. Follow along with the exercises and practice as you go. Modify the code, experiment with new techniques, and don't hesitate to revisit core concepts as needed.

## Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with essential libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Scikit-learn`.
- A desire to revisit and enhance your skills!
