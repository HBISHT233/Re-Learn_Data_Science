    "\n",
    "### **Exercise: NumPy Array Manipulation and Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a dataset that contains the number of hours a student studied each day for a month. Using NumPy, perform various tasks and operations on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dataset: Hours studied each day for a month (30 days)\n",
    "hours_studied = np.array([1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 2, 5, 3, 7, 5, \n",
    "                          6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 2, 5, \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reshape the Array**:\n",
    "   Reshape the `hours_studied` array into a 2D array with 5 rows and 6 columns. Display the reshaped array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Total Hours**:\n",
    "   Calculate the total number of hours the student studied over the month using NumPy's sum function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Daily Average**:\n",
    "   Find the average number of hours studied per day for the entire month.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Find Maximum and Minimum Hours**:\n",
    "   Identify the day with the maximum and minimum hours of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Replace Values**:\n",
    "   Replace all occurrences of 5 hours or more with 10. Print the modified array.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cumulative Sum**:\n",
    "   Calculate the cumulative sum of the hours studied for the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "   Compute the standard deviation of the number of hours studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Boolean Masking**:\n",
    "   Create a Boolean mask for days where the student studied more than 6 hours. Use the mask to print the days with more than 6 hours of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Matrix Operations**:\n",
    "   Generate another random 2D array of shape (5,6) with values between 1 and 10, and add this new array to the reshaped `hours_studied` array from Task 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Linear Space Array**:\n",
    "    Create a 1D array with 50 equally spaced numbers between the minimum and maximum hours studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Extra Challenge:**\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Sorting**:\n",
    "    Sort the `hours_studied` array in descending order. Display the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Dot Product**:\n",
    "    Create a new 1D array representing the difficulty level of each day (random integers between 1 and 3) and compute the dot product between this array and the original `hours_studied` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Skills Tested**:\n",
    "- Array creation, reshaping\n",
    "- Mathematical operations on arrays\n",
    "- Boolean indexing, slicing\n",
    "- Aggregation functions (sum, mean, etc.)\n",
    "- Broadcasting and matrix operations\n",
